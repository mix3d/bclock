        <h3>Welcome to Beautiful Clock</h3>

<p>Beautiful clock was started like most other projects; I was looking for something and just couldn't find it. I moved locations at work, and my new desk-phone was an older model with no clock. I wanted an attractive, sleek, well designed clock to display fullscreen on my second monitor and/or my iPad, and couldnt find one, so I started this. Technically it is a clone of many other clock apps, but mine is free and open source. </p>

<h3>Runs anywhere</h3>

<p>Written in plain HMTL and Javascript, it is simple and lightweight, letting the design shine through.
Currently it runs on most browsers and tablets, but the beauty of it lies in that it only needs a few css changes to make it fit phones. I plan on adding more features before I design for phones. It also has iphone/ipad web-app support, so it will work like a native app when you pin it to the homescreen.</p>

<h3>Customizable</h3>

<p>Works for both portrait and landscape themes.
While there are just a few set themes now, the following features are planned and in the works:</p>

<ul>
<li>User customizable style selection, including font, color, background, and maybe even clock position
</li>
<li>Timed style rotation
</li>
<li>Preferences stored locally
</li>
<li>Weather integration
</li>
<li>Feel free to message me with more ideas 
</li>
</ul><h3>Enjoy!</h3>
